### ðŸ’» Hi, welcome to my profile!

I'm a software developer most proficent in **C++ and Python** building projects which are practical, useful to society or that I just find cool. Some of those projects have included:

- [**VaxBot**](https://github.com/Vaccine-Hunters-Canada/VaxFinder-Discord), a tool made for Vaccine Hunters Canada to locate COVID-19 vaccination appointments through a Discord interface
- [**Lightype**](https://github.com/jman005/lighttype), a lightweight PyQt5 typing-test program 
- [**ArchiveIt**](https://github.com/jman005/ArchiveIt), a Reddit bot made to preserve posts into an offline format

Click on the hyperlinks of each project to check them out.

**jman005/jman005** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
