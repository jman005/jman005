### Hi, welcome to my profile!

I'm a software developer most proficent in **C++ and Python** building projects which are practical, useful to society or that I just find cool. Some of those projects have included:

- **ArchiveIt**, a Reddit bot made to preserve posts into an offline format
- **VaxBot**, a tool made for Vaccine Hunters Canada to locate COVID-19 vaccination appointments through a Discord interface

Have a look at my pinned repositories for more information!
